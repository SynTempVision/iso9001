## 2. Order Receipt & Work Order (QA)
- Customer orders are received and converted into a work order.
- Work orders are created by management or authorized personnel.
- Orders are reviewed for completeness, including:
   - product type
   - range
   - tolerance
   - quantity
- If requirements are unclear or missing, work stops until clarification is obtained.
- Record: Work Order (Order Review section)

## 3. Material Selection (QA)
- Materials (wire, ceramic, metal, flanges, etc.) are selected based on work order requirements.
- Materials are visually inspected for suitability and damage.
- Nonconforming or damaged material is not used.
- Record: Work Order (Material verification note, if applicable)

## 4. Manufacturing / Machining
- Parts are produced according to work order requirements by the operator.
- Manufacturing steps follow established practices.

## 5. Assembly / Fabrication
- Components are assembled into finished thermocouple assemblies.
- Assembly follows defined work practices and job requirements.

## 6. Calibration / Verification (QC)
- Finished assemblies are calibrated or verified against defined acceptance criteria.
- Verification results are recorded.
- Pass / fail decisions are made by authorized personnel
- Nonconforming Output
- If verification fails, the product is not shipped.
- Rework or scrap decisions are made and recorded.
- Record: Verification / Calibration record or Work Order sign-off

## 7. Labeling & Identification
- Products are labeled or identified with job or work order information.
- Traceability is maintained as applicable to product requirements.

## 8. Final Review & Packaging (QC)
- Final checks confirm:
- correct product
- correct customer
- required documentation present
- Packaging is completed after successful final review.
- Record: Work Order (Final review sign-off)

## 9. Shipping
- Only verified and approved products are shipped.
- Shipping details are recorded.

## 10. Role Flexibility
- Where staffing requires, one individual may perform multiple process steps.
- QA/QC checks and records are used to maintain control and prevent nonconforming product shipment.
